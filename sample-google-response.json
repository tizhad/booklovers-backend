        "description": "Dit boek legt de managementaspecten van DevOps uit voor degenen die zich professioneel bezighouden met informatie- en technologiemanagement. Het is geschreven voor IT-specialisten, IT-managers en IT-executives. Het toont DevOps niet als een fenomeen dat geassocieerd wordt met nieuwe automatiseringstools, programmeertechnieken of -technologieën en het verschilt van andere boeken door het gestructureerde verhaal (misschien is het overmatig gestructureerd) en door de poging om het fenomeen DevOps volledig te dekken op zowel een basis- als een fundamenteel niveau. Door die benadering wordt de lezer zich bewust van het nieuwe onderwerp en helpt het boek de fundering de bouwen, de basis. De lezer leert over de oorsprong van DevOps, de onvermijdelijkheid van zijn opkomst, de belangrijkste voorwaarden ervan en hoe die in de praktijk tot uiting komen, over de praktijk zelf en de principes waarop die is gebaseerd. In dit boek staat de stof voor de EXIN DevOps Foundation certificering. Dit examen test het begrip van (1) de basisconcepten van DevOps, (2) hoe deze aan elkaar gerelateerd zijn, en (3) de waarde van DevOps voor de business. EXIN DevOps Foundation is het eerste niveau van het EXIN DevOps certificeringsprogramma. De EXIN DevOps Professional certificering test de kennis van de DevOps praktijk en van hoe teams te integreren. De EXIN DevOps Master certificering gaat over het bevorderen van organisatieverandering en over het toeleiden naar continu leveren en verbeteren.",

DevOps is a set of best practices that emphasize the collaboration and communication of IT-professionals (developers, operators, and support staff) in the lifecycle of applications and services, leading to:• Continuous Integration: merging all developed working copies to a shared mainline several times a day• Continuous Deployment: release continuously or as often as possible• Continuous Feedback: seek feedback from stakeholders during all lifecycle stages The DevOps practices covered in this certification are derived from the Three Ways:- The First Way is to enable the work to move fast from left to right, from Development to Operations to the customer.- The Second Way is to enable feedback to go fast from right to left, from all stakeholders back into the value stream.- The Third Way is to enable learning by creating a high-trust culture of experimentation and risk-taking. Moreover, the crucial subjects of security in all stages, and maintaining compliance during change are covered.The certification has been developed in cooperation with experts in the DevOps work field.Recommended per knowledge: Pre-knowledge of Agile, Lean and/or IT Service Management, for instance through the EXIN Agile Scrum Foundation exam, LITA Lean IT Foundation exam or EXIN IT Service Management Foundation based on ISO/IEC 20000 exam, is recommended.",

        "description": "This book explains the management aspects of DevOps for those who are professionally engaged in information and technology management. It is written for IT specialists, IT managers and IT executives. It does not show DevOps as a phenomenon associated with new automation tools, programming techniques or technologies; It differs from other books by the structural nature of the narrative (perhaps, excessively structured) approach and by the attempt to cover fully the phenomenon of DevOps at a basic, fundamental level. By this approach, this book not only creates awareness of the new subject area but is also helps building the basics. The reader learns about the origins of DevOps, the inevitability of its emergence, the key prerequisites and their reflection in practices, about the practices themselves and the principles on which they are based. This book is the core literature of the EXIN DevOps Foundation certification. This exam tests the understanding of basic DevOps concepts and how they relate to each other, as well as the value of DevOps for the business. EXIN DevOps Foundation is the first level of the EXIN DevOps certification program. The EXIN DevOps Professional certification tests the knowledge of DevOps practices and how to integrate teams. The EXIN DevOps Master certification is about promoting organizational change and leading the way towards continuous delivery and improvement.",

This concise guide assists leaders who are accountable for the rapid development of high-quality software applications. In DevOps for Digital Leaders, deep collective experience on both sides of the dev–ops divide informs the global thought leadership and penetrating insights of the authors, all three of whom are cross-portfolio DevOps leaders at CA Technologies. Aruna Ravichandran, Kieran Taylor, and Peter Waterhouse analyze the organizational benefits, costs, freedoms, and constraints of DevOps. They chart the coordinated strategy of organizational change, metrics, lean thinking, and investment that an enterprise must undertake to realize the full potential of DevOps and reach the sweet spot where accelerating code deployments drive increasing customer satisfaction, revenue, and profitability. Digital leaders are charged to bridge the dev–ops disconnect if their organizations are to survive and flourish in a business world increasingly differentiated by the degree to which dynamic application software development harmonizes with operational resilience and reliability. This short book applies the DevOps perspective to the competitive challenge, faced by every high-performance IT organization today, of integrating and automating open source, cloud, and enterprise tools, processes, and techniques across the software development life cycle from requirements to release. What You Will Learn: Remove dependencies and constraints so that parallel practices can accelerate the development of defect-free software Automate continuous delivery across the software life cycle to eliminate release bottlenecks, manual labor waste, and technical debt accumulation Generate virtualized production-style testing of applications through real-time behavioral analytics Adopt agile practices so operations teams can support developer productivity with automated feedback, streamline infrastructure monitoring, spot and resolve operations issues before they impact production, and improve customer experience Identify the DevOps metrics appropriate to your organization and integrate DevOps with your existing best practices and investment Who This Book Is For: IT leaders in large companies and government agencies who have any level of responsibility for the rapid development of high-quality software applications. The secondary readership is members of development and operations teams, security professionals, and service managers.",

        "description": "The First Complete Guide to DevOps for Software Architects DevOps promises to accelerate the release of new software features and improve monitoring of systems in production, but its crucial implications for software architects and architecture are often ignored. In DevOps: A Software Architect’s Perspective, three leading architects address these issues head-on. The authors review decisions software architects must make in order to achieve DevOps’ goals and clarify how other DevOps participants are likely to impact the architect’s work. They also provide the organizational, technical, and operational context needed to deploy DevOps more efficiently, and review DevOps’ impact on each development phase. The authors address cross-cutting concerns that link multiple functions, offering practical insights into compliance, performance, reliability, repeatability, and security. This guide demonstrates the authors’ ideas in action with three real-world case studies: datacenter replication for business continuity, management of a continuous deployment pipeline, and migration to a microservice architecture. Comprehensive coverage includes • Why DevOps can require major changes in both system architecture and IT roles • How virtualization and the cloud can enable DevOps practices • Integrating operations and its service lifecycle into DevOps • Designing new systems to work well with DevOps practices • Integrating DevOps with agile methods and TDD • Handling failure detection, upgrade planning, and other key issues • Managing consistency issues arising from DevOps’ independent deployment models • Integrating security controls, roles, and audits into DevOps • Preparing a business plan for DevOps adoption, rollout, and measurement",

The sequel, The Unicorn Project, is coming Nov 26*** “Every person involved in a failed IT project should be forced to read this book.”—TIM O’REILLY, Founder & CEO of O’Reilly Media “The Phoenix Project is a must read for business and IT executives who are struggling with the growing complexity of IT.”—JIM WHITEHURST, President and CEO, Red Hat, Inc. Five years after this sleeper hit took on the world of IT and flipped it on it's head, the 5th Anniversary Edition of The Phoenix Project continues to guide IT in the DevOps revolution. In this newly updated and expanded edition of the bestselling The Phoenix Project, co-author Gene Kim includes a new afterword and a deeper delve into the Three Ways as described in The DevOps Handbook. Bill, an IT manager at Parts Unlimited, has been tasked with taking on a project critical to the future of the business, code named Phoenix Project. But the project is massively over budget and behind schedule. The CEO demands Bill must fix the mess in ninety days or else Bill's entire department will be outsourced. With the help of a prospective board member and his mysterious philosophy of The Three Ways, Bill starts to see that IT work has more in common with a manufacturing plant work than he ever imagined. With the clock ticking, Bill must organize work flow streamline interdepartmental communications, and effectively serve the other business functions at Parts Unlimited. In a fast-paced and entertaining style, three luminaries of the DevOps movement deliver a story that anyone who works in IT will recognize. Readers will not only learn how to improve their own IT organizations, they'll never view IT the same way again. “This book is a gripping read that captures brilliantly the dilemmas that face companies which depend on IT, and offers real-world solutions.”—JEZ HUMBLE, Co-author of Continuous Delivery, Lean Enterprise, Accelerate, and The DevOps Handbook ———— “I’m delighted at how The Phoenix Project has reshaped so many conversations in technology. My goal in writing The Unicorn Project was to explore and reveal the necessary but invisible structures required to make developers (and all engineers) productive, and reveal the devastating effects of technical debt and complexity. I hope this book can create common ground for technology and business leaders to leave the past behind, and co-create a better future together.”—Gene Kim, November 2019",

        "description": "Increase profitability, elevate work culture, and exceed productivity goals through DevOps practices. More than ever, the effective management of technology is critical for business competitiveness. For decades, technology leaders have struggled to balance agility, reliability, and security. The consequences of failure have never been greater―whether it's the healthcare.gov debacle, cardholder data breaches, or missing the boat with Big Data in the cloud. And yet, high performers using DevOps principles, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Etsy, and Netflix, are routinely and reliably deploying code into production hundreds, or even thousands, of times per day. Following in the footsteps of The Phoenix Project, The DevOps Handbook shows leaders how to replicate these incredible outcomes, by showing how to integrate Product Management, Development, QA, IT Operations, and Information Security to elevate your company and win in the marketplace.",
